## Course Overview

Analytic Geometry studies Euclidean geometry through coordinate systems, enabling the description of geometric phenomena via algebraic equations. In addition to formalizing fundamental concepts of linear algebra, this subject finds direct applications in Physics, Statistics, and Computer Science, among many other fields. For most students, this course represents their first encounter with more abstract and formal mathematical structures.

## Syllabus

Matrices and linear systems. Vectors and operations. Bases and coordinate systems. Distance, norm, and angle. Dot and cross products. Lines in the plane and in space. Planes. Relative positions, intersections, distances, and angles. Circle and sphere. Polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. Conic sections and classification. Introduction to quadrics.

## Use of References and Materials

There are many excellent books covering the syllabus and content. Students are encouraged to study from their own class notes, the textbook, and any additional material provided by the instructor. **The use of online platforms, including AI-powered tools, for solving exercises is strongly discouraged.**

## Lecture Format

The course will be delivered **in person**. In exceptional cases, remote lectures may be considered.

## Practical Component

Students are expected to practice independently by solving exercises from the textbook and problem sets. They are encouraged to seek support during office hours and tutoring sessions. Lectures will focus on content development but may include time for problem solving and questions.

## Tutoring

This course will be assisted by a PAD tutor (Teaching Support Program) and a PED teaching assistant (Teaching Internship Program). Their scheduled availability is listed below:

## Grading Policy

Grades will be based on assignments and attendance. Throughout the semester, students will complete two assignments and one exam. Each assessment will be graded on a scale from $$0$$ to $$10$$:

- $$T_1$$: First assignment  
- $$T_2$$: Second assignment  
- $$P$$: Exam

The semester grade $$\text{MS}$$ will be computed as:

$$
\text{MS} = \max\left\{ 0.2 \cdot T_1 + 0.2 \cdot T_2 + 0.6 \cdot P,\; P \right\}
$$

Evaluation criteria:

- $$\text{MS} \geq 6$$: Passed, grade recorded  
- $$2.5 \leq \text{MS} < 6$$: Final decision based on final exam  
- $$\text{MS} < 2.5$$: Failed, grade recorded

If a **Final Exam** $$\text{EF}$$ is required:
The semester grade $$\text{MS}$$ will be computed as:

$$
\text{MF} = \dfrac{\text{MS} + \text{EF}}{2}
$$

The minimum attendance required is $$\mathbf{75\%}$$, corresponding to $$\mathbf{45}$$ **class hours**.

## Absences on Assessment Days

Students who miss an assessment due to medical reasons must submit a medical certificate to the instructor within five business days. If accepted, the exam grade may be replaced by the Final Exam grade. In case of absence during assignment deadlines, a replacement activity may be provided at the instructor’s discretion.
