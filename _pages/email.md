### ðŸ“¬ A quick note about email delivery

I receive a huge amount of spam every day, so I've had to set up pretty strict filters. If we've never emailed before and you're not using an academic address, your message might take a while to reach me -- but don't worry, I'll find it eventually!

If it's something urgent, it's a good idea to give me a call before sending an email.

**Please don't send multiple copies of the same message** -- this can trigger the spam filter and get your address blocked permanently.

Thanks for your understanding!
