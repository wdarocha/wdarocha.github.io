Hi! Welcome! I'm Wagner Alan Aparecido da Rocha. I was born in [Mogi-Guaçu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogi_Gua%C3%A7u), [São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)), [Brazil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil), but my roots are in [Inconfidentes](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconfidentes), a small town in [Minas Gerais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais) -- which gave me a mix of urban upbringing and rural heritage. Right now, I'm on my second [postdoctoral researcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) journey, continuing to explore the intersection of math, science, and real-world problems. Over the years, I've grown passionate about using mathematical tools to tackle real-world challenges.

I've been at the [University of Campinas](https://unicamp.br/en/) (UNICAMP), in [Campinas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campinas), São Paulo, Brazil, for most of my academic journey -- both my undergraduate and graduate studies were carried out at the [Institute of Mathematics, Statistics, and Scientific Computing](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/en) (IMECC), and I also spent time at the ["Gleb Wataghin" Institute of Physics](https://portal.ifi.unicamp.br/en/) (IFGW), two institutes of UNICAMP. During my [Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy), I had the opportunity to spend a research period abroad at the [Laboratoire d'informatique de l'École Polytechnique](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) (LIX), part of the [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/)/[Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), in [Palaiseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaiseau) (a commune in the southern suburbs of [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris)), [France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France).

Here's a quick summary of my academic background:  

<!--

1. [B.Sc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science) in [Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/sistemas/catalogos/grad/catalogo2011/cursos/cur28.html) (2014), with an emphasis on [Biomathematics](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/sistemas/catalogos/grad/catalogo2011/cursos/sug28.html) and [Numerical Analysis](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/sistemas/catalogos/grad/catalogo2011/cursos/sug28.html)
1. [B.Ed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Education) in [Mathematics](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/sistemas/catalogos/grad/catalogo2011/cursos/cur01.html) (2019)
1. B.Ed. in [Physics](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/sistemas/catalogos/grad/catalogo2011/cursos/cur04.html) (2021)
1. [M.Sc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science) in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/sistemas/catalogos/pos-grad/catalogo2017/unidade/imecc-339/cursos/curso_29m.html) (2017)
1. Ph.D. in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/sistemas/catalogos/pos-grad/catalogo2017/unidade/imecc-339/cursos/curso_79d.html) (2022)

During my [bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science)'s degree, I worked on modeling population growth using [Ordinary Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) (ODEs). More specifically, I studied tumor cell growth through an ODE-based model.

In my [master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science)'s degree, I worked in collaboration with the [Neurophysics Group](https://portal.ifi.unicamp.br/drcc/gnf) (GNF) at IFGW. There, we studied brain networks constructed from human [fMRI images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging). In this project, we represented the brain as a [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and analyzed its structural properties.

In my Ph.D., I changed my research topic, and since then, my work has focused on the [Distance Geometry Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_geometry) and its applications to [protein structure determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_determination) using [Nuclear Magnetic Resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance) (NMR).

After finishing my Ph.D., I moved to Paris and started a postdoc at LIX, in collaboration with the [Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie Théoriques](https://lpct.cnrs.fr/en/home/) (LPCT) at the [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/en/univ-lorraine/) (UL), in [Nancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy,_France) (eastern France, close to [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg)), where I stayed for 1.5 years. It was a great chance to work closer to real-world problems, and I got hands-on with large-scale simulations at the [EXPLOR center](https://explor.univ-lorraine.fr) mesocenter for high-performance computing.

Now, for my second postdoc, I'm back at IMECC/UNICAMP -- and still having fun with math and molecules -- and constantly debugging code.
